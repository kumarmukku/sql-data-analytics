# SQL Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview 
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for end-to-end data analytics: from loading and cleaning data, to querying and analysing patterns, to deriving actionable insights. I built it as my first full SQL analytics pipeline to strengthen my skills in relational databases and query-based analysis.

##  Key Objectives  
- Design and populate a relational database/schema suited for the dataset.  
- Write SQL queries to clean/filter/join/aggregate data.  
- Explore and analyse data to uncover trends, outliers and insights.    
- Optimize queries and structure for readability and performance.

## Tech Stack  
- SQL dialect: mysql
- Dataset domain: sales 
- Project folders:  
  - `datasets/` – raw and processed data  
  - `initialization/` – SQL scripts to create tables and load data  
  - `analysis/` – SQL queries used for exploration and analytics  
  - `reporting/` – summary scripts
